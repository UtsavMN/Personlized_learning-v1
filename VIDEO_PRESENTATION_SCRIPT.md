# Mentora: Video Presentation Script

## 1. Problem (The "Why")
*Script / Talking Points:*
"Standard education suffers from a 'One-Size-Fits-All' problem. Students have different energy levels, learning curves, and gaps in knowledge, yet they are all forced into the same static schedules and generic assessments. This leads to burnout for some and boredom for others. We need a system that adapts to the **student**, not the other way around."

## 2. Working of the System (The "How")
*Script / Talking Points:*
"Mentora solves this using a **Local-First Multi-Agent Architecture**.
1.  **The Scheduler Agent**: uses Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning) to track my energy levels and automatically suggests when to study Math vs. when to take a break.
2.  **The Content Agent**: instantly analyzes my documents (like this Computer Networks PDF) and generates verified quizzes on the fly.
3.  **The Predictor Agent**: runs a Neural Network right here in the browser to forecast my exam grades based on my study habits.
All of this happens **offline** on my device, ensuring complete privacy."

## 3. Output/Results (The "What you see")
*Demonstrate these steps in the video:*
1.  **Dashboard**: Show the "Study Tracker" and "Grade Predictor" widgets updating in real-time.
2.  **The Lab**: Open "The Lab" and show the consolidated tools (Timer, Calculator).
3.  **Instant Quiz**: Click "Generate Quiz". Show the **Computer Networks** questions appearing instantly (0 latency).
4.  **Privacy**: Disconnect WiFi (optional) to show the app still works.
5.  **Conclusion**: "Mentora successfully creates a personalized feedback loop: Better Scheduling -> Better Focus -> Higher Grades."
