Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy. 
The chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water. 
In most cases, oxygen is also released as a waste product. Most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis.
