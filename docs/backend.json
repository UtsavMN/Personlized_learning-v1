All documents are stored in a single `documents` collection, which avoids complex authorization logic and supports efficient retrieval. There is no ownership in this design as the documents are pre-uploaded and available in the backend. This achieves authorization independence since every document has the same security posture. The `documents` collection enables secure `list` operations since all documents share the same security requirements and there is no need for filtering based on access control."
