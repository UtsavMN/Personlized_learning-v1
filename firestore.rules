/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the academic document repository.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to all documents while preventing unauthorized modifications.
 * There is no ownership model; all documents are considered publicly accessible for reading.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * Documents are stored in the top-level `/documents/{documentId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Documents are pre-uploaded and managed by the backend.
 * - No user-specific data or ownership is enforced.
 * - Anyone can read any document.
 * - Writes (create, update, delete) are completely forbidden to prevent unauthorized modifications of the pre-uploaded documents.
